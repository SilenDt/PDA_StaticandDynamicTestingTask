### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:

  # the equals sign should be a double equals sign 
  # else needs a colon after it
  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False
   
  #dif should be def
  #missing a comma between card1 and card2 in line 29
  #the if statement needs to be indented 
  #the else statement should also be intented to be in line with the if statement
  #the first return statement should return card1, not card
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  

#the whole function needs to be indented
#the total variable needs to be created with a value of 0
#the return needs to be moved outside of the for loop
def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
